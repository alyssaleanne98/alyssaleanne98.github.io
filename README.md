## Issues and Resolutions

 Major issues includes the following: 
 1. Layout of the entire website
	The layout of the pages and scroll feature was the easiest task to complete as it was the foundation of my project. I was able to accomplish the layout for the phone view and website view initially. As I continued developing my portfolio with HTML and CSS, I ran into a few issues of my original layout altering as I added more code. 
 2. Correcting the function of the navigation bar and directory.
 3. Positioning all elements and texts.
	Positioning was the most challenging task to complete. Positioning of the objects and texts did not go the way I wished for it to. After looking up tutorials, debug how-to's, and applying different methods of what may work, I was not able to accomplish the desired layout of my portfolio. 
4. Correcting phone view. 
	As I applied the media query, I ran into the issue of having additional white space to the right of my page. I applied "overflow: hidden" that resolved the layout I was wishing to accomplish. 
5. Organization: 
	The difficulty of my first project was definitely underestimated. I did not take the necessary time to plan the layout, design, or pseudocode of my project before beginning. As I began to add elements and design my portfolio page-to-page, I found myself jumping from one page to another when I ran into an issue, rather than tackling each issue as I went along.
